📦 How to Use MyG_Starter_Project.zip
✅ Goal:
Run the full MyG fitness app on your Mac using Xcode and your own Apple ID — no Apple Developer account needed.

🛠 Prerequisites
Mac running macOS Monterey or later

Xcode 14+ installed from the App Store

A free Apple ID signed into Xcode

📁 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions
1. Unzip the File
Locate MyG_Starter_Project.zip in your downloads

Right-click → “Open” to unzip

You’ll now see a folder named MyG

2. Open Xcode and Create a New Project
Launch Xcode

Select: Create a new Xcode project

Template: Choose App under iOS

Click Next

Fill in the project info:
Product Name: MyG

Interface: SwiftUI

Language: Swift

Uncheck Core Data and Tests

Click Next → Choose a location to save

3. Replace Default Files with Provided Files
In Finder, open the unzipped MyG folder

Open the Sources/ folder

Back in Xcode:
Right-click the project group (in the sidebar) → Delete ContentView.swift and MyGApp.swift (the ones Xcode created)

Drag all .swift files from Sources/ into the Xcode project navigator

✅ Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked

✅ Make sure "Add to targets: MyG" is checked

4. Add Required Resources
Still in Xcode:

Drag the Info.plist file into your project (replace the existing one)

Drag HealthierEateries.geojson into the project as well

In the right sidebar, ensure it's added to the "Copy Bundle Resources" section

5. Set Up Signing with Your Apple ID
Click the project name at the top of the sidebar

Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab

Under Team, choose your Apple ID (or add one via Xcode > Settings > Accounts)

Change the Bundle Identifier to something unique (e.g., com.yourname.MyGTestApp)

Xcode will generate a provisioning profile for free deployment

6. Run the App
At the top, choose a simulator (e.g., iPhone 14)

Click ▶️ Run

💡 First launch may take a few seconds as backend services wake up.

✅ Feature Checklist to Test
🔐 Authentication (Signup, Login, Google Login)

🏋️ Workout Logging

💡 Tips
Make sure your Mac is connected to the internet

You can run the app on your real iPhone if you plug it in and trust the device in Xcode
